**NOTE**: Encode your (proxy) password to avoid clashes with unsupported characters (such as '@'), using https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/

**NOTE**: We set the POSTGRES_DB environment variable in the docker file, otherwise it will use the POSTGRES_USER as database name.

**NOTE**: Remove Docker volume 'pgdata' if you want to start postgres with database initialization.

### Figure: Diagram (needs rework to display the true architecture)

Run as follows:

```
$ cd containers/app
$ docker-compose --file docker-compose.dev.yml --project-name plot-management-dev up --build -d
```

**NOTE**: If you get the following error when browsing the Plotly service: 

``````
Unhandled Runtime Error
ApolloError: Failed to fetch
``````

Know that this is most likely caused by the Hasura service not being up and running yet, therefor not able to sent the requested data to the Plotly Service. To fix it, start the Hasura service.

**NOTE**: When you try to login to PostgreSQL database via **pgAdmin** (Recommended), use the following credentials:

- Email Address / Username: = Use the value of PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL_DEV/PROD as specified in the .env file
- Password: Use the value of PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD_DEV/PROD as specified in the .env file

Inside pgAdmin register a new Server using the following credentials:

Right-Click Servers > Register ... Server:

In tab **General**:

- Name: Use a name like "plot-management-dev" (if for development) - REQUIRED

In tab **Connection**:

- Host name/address: **localhost** if network_mode is host, or **IP of host** otherwise (recommended).
- Port: = Use the value of port for the container if network_mode is host, or of the host otherwise (recommended), as specified in the docker-compose file =
- Maintenance database: **postgres**
- Username: = Use the value of POSTGRES_USER_DEV/PROD as specified in .env file =
- Password: = Use the value of POSTGRES_PASSWORD_DEV/PROD as specified in .env file =

**NOTE**: When you try to login to Hasura, use the following credentials:

- Admin secret: = Use the value of HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET_DEV/PROD as specified in .env file =

## Hasura

### Connect Your First Database

See http://hostname:hasura-port-number/console/data/manage/connect

- Database Display Name: **Plot Management - Dev** (for development)
- Data Source Driver: **Postgres**
- Connect Database Via: **Database URL**
- Database URL: **postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/databasename**, use the value of HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL_DEV/PROD as specified in .env file

- Extensions Schema: = stay with the default =
- Connection Settings: = stay with the default =
- GraphQL Field Customization: = stay with the default =

**WARNING**: make sure you did not copy ```sample.hasura_metadata.json``` to the Dockerhost as it will confuse it when there is already a ```hasura_metadata.json``` there.

**WARNING**: make sure you did not copy ```sample.hasura_migrations.json``` to the Dockerhost as it will confuse it when there is already a ```hasura_migrations.json``` there.

### Define the Schema in Postgres for Our Plot Management Service

The schema of our plot management service is based on Plotly and should follow a nesting alike below:

```
	[
     {
       id: 1,
       position: { x: 36,
       y: 36 }
     },
     {
       id: 2,
       position: { x: 136,
       y: 136 }
     },
     {
       id: 3,
       position: { x: 236,
       y: 236 }
     },
  ]          
```
Example of a schema for Plotly nodes.

```
	 [
     {
       source: 1,
       target: 2
     },
     {
       source: 2,
       target: 3
     }
  ]      
```
Example of a schema for Plotly links.

Taken together, here is the schema for a map (which combines nodes and links):

```
  id: 1,

  nodes: [
     {
       id: 1,
       position: { x: 36,
       y: 36 }
     },
     {
       id: 2,
       position: { x: 136,
       y: 136 }
     },
     {
       id: 3,
       position: { x: 236,
       y: 236 }
     },
  ],

  links: [
     {
       source: 1,
       target: 2
     },
     {
       source: 2,
       target: 3
     }
  ]

```
Example of a schema for a Plotly plot.


Nodes are unique, they can only exist once (with the same unique identifier).

Links are a relation ship between nodes. One link can link to two nodes (source and target).

Hence the relationship between a node and a link is **1-to-many**.

In creating the tables & views see the following:

- Nodes schema: see containers/app/postgresql/sql/

- Links schema: see containers/app/postgresql/sql/

- Plots schema: see containers/app/postgresql/sql/

Plots are a collection of nodes and links.

In hasura you can - after having connected to the database and tracked the views - now run a query like below to get a JSON output:

```
query fetchFirstPlot {
  first_plot: plots_view(where: {name: {_eq: "first"}}) {
    nodes {
      id
      position
    }
    links {
      source
      target
    }
  }
}
```

Example outcome of above query:

```
{
  "data": {
    "first_plot": [
      {
        "nodes": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "position": {
              "x": 36,
              "y": 36
            }
          },
          {
            "id": 2,
            "position": {
              "x": 136,
              "y": 136
            }
          },
          {
            "id": 3,
            "position": {
              "x": 236,
              "y": 236
            }
          }
        ],
        "links": [
          {
            "source": 1,
            "target": 2
          },
          {
            "source": 2,
            "target": 3
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**TIP**: To format the code, select the code and in Visual Studio Code (after installing the Prettier extension) combine the following keys: CTRL + SHIFT + P. A dialogue window will ask you for what command you want to execute, type "format" and from the dropdown options choose "prettier". This will format the selected code.

To be more precise in which file(s) to format, for example when in ```containers/app/plotly``` you can run the following:

```
$ npx prettier --write src/app/page.tsx
```

It will take the configuration from ```containers/app/plotly/.prettierrc```

See for documentation on **Prettier**, https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html
